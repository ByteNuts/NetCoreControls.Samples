## Features
**- Independent from data source** - you can use any data source you prefer. Just set up a method that returns the data you want to display.

**- Dynamic models allowed** - there is no need to create a model to render data to a control. Just return dynamic from your data method.

**- AJAX Enabled** - all controls use AJAX to communicate with the server and perform their actions.

**- Controls are connected** - you can easily associate a submit button or a filter with more than one control, even with different controls.

**- Subscribe control events or create custom ones** - all controls share the same base events. They also offer some other events related to the control itself. But hey!, if that isnâ€™t enough, you can create your one custom events!
